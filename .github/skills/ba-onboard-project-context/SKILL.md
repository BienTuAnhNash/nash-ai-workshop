## Prerequisites & Inputs

- **Target Project Path**: Confirmed path to the target repository or folder being onboarded (must be explicitly provided by the user or elicited via `ask_question`).
- **Artifact Hosting & Commit Permission**: Explicit confirmation of whether BA artifacts (`.agent-artifacts/`) are generated in a dedicated non-source repo or directly in the application source code repo. If in the source code repo, explicit confirmation of whether committing automation scripts (`skills/*/scripts/`) and `.agent-artifacts/` into source control is permitted.
- **Workspace Access**: Read and write access to the workspace root directory and `.agent-artifacts/`.
- **Target Project Documentation**: Any existing specifications, wiki pages, diagrams, or proposal documents in folders like `docs/`, `wiki/`, or sibling repositories.
- **ALM Credentials (Optional)**: Atlassian or Azure DevOps credentials if configuring backlog synchronization during onboarding.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Target Project Path Verification Gate (Stop & Ask)

1. Inspect the user prompt for an explicit project folder or repository path.
2. **If path is missing or ambiguous**:
   - **STOP IMMEDIATELY**.
   - Invoke the `ask_question` tool:
     - **Question**: _"Which project repository or folder would you like to onboard into the BA Accelerator?"_
     - **Option 1 (Recommended)**: _"Current workspace root (`./`)"_
     - **Option 2**: _"[Select detected sibling repository] (e.g. `../<sibling-repo>`)"_
     - **Option 3**: _"[Enter custom project folder path]"_
   - Wait for the user's selection before initiating any scans or authoring tasks.

### Step 2: Artifact Hosting Location & Script Commit Policy Gate (Stop & Confirm)

1. Invoke the `ask_question` tool to determine hosting topology:
   - **Question**: _"Where should BA artifacts (`.agent-artifacts/`) and automation skills be hosted?"_
   - **Option 1 (Recommended)**: _"Dedicated non-source repo / folder (e.g. separate requirements repository or shared BA folder)"_
   - **Option 2**: _"Directly inside the application source code repository"_
2. **If Option 2 (Inside application source repo) is selected**:
   - Prompt the user with a mandatory script commit permission question:
     - **Question**: _"Are you permitted to commit BA automation scripts (`skills/_/scripts/`) and `.agent-artifacts/` directly into this application source code repository?"\*
     - **Option 1 (Permitted)**: _"Yes, commit scripts and artifacts directly into source control."_
     - **Option 2 (Restricted / Configure .gitignore)**: _"No, keep source control clean. Add scripts and `.agent-artifacts/` to `.gitignore`."_
3. **Action Based on User Response**:
   - If restricted: Append `.agent-artifacts/` and `skills/*/scripts/` to `.gitignore` in the target project root and document the local-only script execution policy in `project-summary.md`.
   - If permitted or hosted in a dedicated repo: Document the confirmed hosting topology and script commit policy in `project-summary.md`.

### Step 3: Pre-Flight Environment Discovery & Workspace Audit

1. Inspect the confirmed target repository directly. Inventory documentation folders, inspect Git history and branches for backlog identifiers, and check BA artifacts and repository topology. Exclude dependency, build, and Git internals from the documentation inventory.
2. Record evidence from that inspection to identify:
   - **Accelerator Baseline**: Presence of `project-summary.md` and status of `.agent-artifacts/`.
   - **Existing Documentation**: Location, formats (`.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`), and volume of existing documentation assets.
   - **Backlog Management Clues**: Detected Jira project keys (e.g. `PROJ`) or Azure DevOps work item tags (`#123`, `AB#123`).
   - **Workspace Topology**: Single-repository vs multi-repo sibling architecture.
3. Present an executive summary of the environment findings to the user.

### Step 4: High-Level Onboarding Plan & User Approval Gate

Before authoring any files, generating stubs, or modifying configurations, formulate a structured **High-Level Onboarding Plan** based on [assets/onboarding-plan.template.md](assets/onboarding-plan.template.md):

| Phase                                           | Proposed Action                     | Target Component / File                             | Source / Baseline Context                 | Notes / Dependencies                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Artifact Topology & Script Commit Policy** | `HOST_DEDICATED` \| `HOST_SRC_REPO` | `.agent-artifacts/` & `scripts/`                    | Dedicated BA repo vs Source Code repo     | Script commit permission confirmed or `.gitignore` configured          |
| **2. Knowledge Ingestion**                      | `MAP_STUBS` \| `SKIP`               | `.agent-artifacts/project-knowledge-base/wiki/`     | Discovered doc folders (`docs/`, `wiki/`) | Progressive hybrid stubs linking to source docs                        |
| **3. Glossary Extraction**                      | `EXTRACT` \| `SKIP`                 | `.agent-artifacts/project-knowledge-base/glossary/` | Source documents / acronyms               | Nouns, actors, and domain terminology                                  |
| **4. Solution Baseline**                        | `CREATE` \| `UPDATE`                | `project-summary.md`                                | Manifests, README, SOW, Architecture      | Core system overview, tech stack, SOW boundaries, Script commit policy |
| **5. Backlog ALM Integration**                  | `CALIBRATE` \| `DORMANT`            | `skills/ba-sync-backlog/references/`                | Jira Key or ADO Area Path                 | MCP pre-flight and custom field mapping                                |
| **6. Workflow & DoR Calibration**               | `ALIGN` \| `DEFAULT`                | `instructions/ba-agent-rules.md`                    | Team Agile / Scrum conventions            | 3-tier Gherkin ACs and Artifact Plan gates                             |

**Mandatory Gate**: Present this plan to the user and prompt:

> _"Please review the proposed Onboarding Plan above. You can update any actions, exclude specific documentation folders, or customize the target Jira/ADO settings. Reply with **'Proceed'** to execute step by step, or specify any adjustments you would like to make."_
> **HALT execution and wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 5: Step-by-Step Execution

Once the user confirms the plan, execute each approved phase sequentially:

1. **Step 5.1: Hybrid Knowledge Ingestion & Indexing**:
   - If `MAP_STUBS` is selected: Run `map_knowledge_base.ps1` on the confirmed source paths:
     ```powershell
     powershell -NoProfile -File skills/ba-onboard-project-context/scripts/map_knowledge_base.ps1 --source <path-to-docs>
     ```
   - If `EXTRACT` is selected: Extract domain nouns and acronyms into `.agent-artifacts/project-knowledge-base/glossary/<term>.md`.
2. **Step 5.2: Solution Context & SOW Baseline Scaffolding**:
   - Scaffold or update `project-summary.md` at the repository root covering:
     - Project Name & Domain Overview
     - System Architecture & Technology Stack
     - Primary Personas / User Roles
     - Core Integrations & Third-party Services
     - Commercial Scope Baseline (Contractual boundaries vs Change Request triggers)
     - Repository Governance & Script Commit Policy (dedicated vs source repo; script commit permissions or `.gitignore` isolation)
   - Record any project-specific Definition of Ready (DoR) overrides.
3. **Step 5.3: Backlog ALM Integration (Jira / Azure DevOps)**:
   - Check MCP server connectivity (`atlassian-mcp-server` or `azure-devops-mcp`).
   - If Jira: Configure Project Key and custom field IDs in `jira-field-mapping.md`.
   - If Azure DevOps: Configure Organization, Project, Area Path, and Iteration Path in `ado-field-mapping.md`.
   - If MCP is offline: Record dormant configuration and reference [references/jira-ado-setup-guide.md](references/jira-ado-setup-guide.md).

### Step 6: Automated Verification & Review Checklist

1. Execute the automated onboarding verification script:
   ```powershell
   powershell -NoProfile -File skills/ba-onboard-project-context/scripts/verify_onboarding.ps1 --output .agent-artifacts/onboarding-review-checklist.md
   ```
2. Present the populated **Onboarding Review Checklist** (based on [assets/onboarding-review-checklist.template.md](assets/onboarding-review-checklist.template.md)) to the user.
3. Verify that all critical checkpoints (`[PASS]`) are satisfied.

### Step 7: Guided Smoke Testing & Test-Drive ("Test it out")

Guide the user through immediate interactive smoke testing to verify the end-to-end setup before regular delivery begins:

1. **Test Drive 1: Knowledge Base Search Test**:
   - Run or prompt the user to run:
     ```powershell
     powershell -NoProfile -File skills/ba-research-project-knowledge/scripts/search_kb.ps1 -q "<sample project concept>"
     ```
   - Verify that the newly indexed progressive stubs return expected excerpts and valid source file links.
2. **Test Drive 2: Backlog Query Test (If ALM configured)**:
   - Run a sample read-only query (e.g. fetching an issue or sprint scope via MCP) to confirm API token permissions.
3. **Test Drive 3: Orchestrator Test-Drive with `@business-analyst`**:
   - Provide a copy-pasteable test prompt for the user to try with `@business-analyst`:
     > _"@business-analyst I need to analyze a new feature for [Feature/Module]. Please review our project summary and search our knowledge base to establish the baseline scope."_
   - Verify that `@business-analyst` reads `project-summary.md`, searches the stubs, and initiates the elicitation gate.

---

## Conditional Branching & Fallbacks

- **Branch: No Existing Documentation (Greenfield Project)**:
  - Skip `map_knowledge_base.ps1`.
  - Prompt the user with 3-4 structured questions to capture the core domain, MVP goals, and actors to seed `project-summary.md`.
- **Branch: MCP Server Unavailable or Not Installed**:
  - Do not block onboarding.
  - Document the target Project Key and field mappings offline in `jira-field-mapping.md` / `ado-field-mapping.md`.
  - Provide setup instructions from [references/jira-ado-setup-guide.md](references/jira-ado-setup-guide.md) for later activation.
- **Branch: Multi-Repository Workspace**:
  - Ensure `project-summary.md` includes the relative paths to sibling repositories.
  - In `copilot-instructions.md`, verify instructions allow cross-repo reading.
- **Fallback: Non-Interactive / Automated Pipeline Mode**:
  - Inspect the confirmed repository's documentation, manifests, Git metadata, and BA artifacts directly.
  - Generate a draft `project-summary.md` from README/manifest files.
  - Run `verify_onboarding.ps1 --output .agent-artifacts/onboarding-review-checklist.md` and halt without executing external mutations.

## Deliverables & Consumer Soundness

- **Primary Consumers**:
  - _Business Analysts & Delivery Leads_: Clear onboarding status report, customized `project-summary.md`, verified review checklist, and immediate delivery readiness.
  - _AI Agents (`@business-analyst`)_: Token-optimized Knowledge Base stubs with source pointers and calibrated field mappings.
- **Physical Deliverables**:
  - Root `project-summary.md`.
  - Onboarding Review Checklist: `.agent-artifacts/onboarding-review-checklist.md`.
  - Knowledge Base stubs in `.agent-artifacts/project-knowledge-base/wiki/*.md`.
  - Calibrated field mappings in `skills/ba-sync-backlog/references/`.
  - Verified onboarding status record.

## Core Tooling (in `scripts/`)

Directly invoke these utilities using the exact CLI syntax below; do not inspect script source code unless diagnosing an execution error:

| Utility                   | Script Command                                                                                                                                         | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Knowledge Base Mapper** | `powershell -NoProfile -File skills/ba-onboard-project-context/scripts/map_knowledge_base.ps1 --source "<path-to-docs>"`                               | Scans external/internal docs and generates hybrid progressive summary stubs linking back to originals. |
| **Onboarding Verifier**   | `powershell -NoProfile -File skills/ba-onboard-project-context/scripts/verify_onboarding.ps1 --output .agent-artifacts/onboarding-review-checklist.md` | Validates end-to-end onboarding completeness and outputs review checklist.                             |

---

## Anti-Patterns & Negative Constraints

- **Never duplicate frontmatter triggers**: Do not add a redundant `## When to Use` section in the markdown body.
- **Never perform destructive document overwrites**: Always preserve original project documentation; map via hybrid progressive stubs rather than displacing original files.
- **Never guess custom Jira/ADO field IDs**: Verify via MCP test query or ask the project BA/admin.
- **Never proceed with delivery without a baseline `project-summary.md`**: Ensure core project summary exists before handing off to `@business-analyst`.
