# Craft Agent & Skill

Orchestrates the end-to-end lifecycle of custom agents (`.agent.md`) and procedural skills (`SKILL.md`):
- **High-Performance Prompts**: Deliver clean execution flow with minimal token waste.
- **Strict DRY & SSOT**: Enforce zero duplicated standards or shadow rules.
- **Reliable Boundaries**: Maintain unambiguous triggers with clean handoffs.
- **Consumer Soundness**: Produce artifacts structurally tailored for AI, code/compilers, or humans.

---

## Core Architectural Principles

All agents and skills designed or reviewed under this skill MUST strictly adhere to these 10 principles:

1. **Mandatory Elicitation & "Infer First, Ask with Options" Rule**:
   - **Interpret First**: Exhaustively analyze prompt, request metadata, and workspace context first. **Only ask if something cannot be interpreted from the prompt**. Never interrogate the user for details already supplied or inferable.
   - **No Pure Open-Ended Questions**: Formulate clarification questions with a **Recommended Approach** alongside concrete **Options (with Pros & Cons)**.
   - **Discipline**: Ask **2–4 high-impact questions per turn**.
2. **Sound & Sensible Trigger Workflows**:
   - **SSOT Triggers**: Skill triggers belong exclusively in YAML frontmatter `description`; agent dispatch belongs in `Mounted Skills & When to Use`.
   - **Isolation**: Triggers must be distinct, unambiguous, and non-overlapping.
3. **Strict DRY & SSOT (Single Source of Truth)**:
   - **Single Home**: Every rule, instruction, or check must live in strictly ONE authoritative file. Never duplicate or paraphrase rules across files.
   - **Referencing Over Duplication**: Link to authoritative SSOT files via progressive disclosure instead of copying rules inline.
4. **Token Optimization & Progressive Disclosure**:
   - **Lean Prompts**: Eliminate conversational filler, fluff, and formatting micromanagement.
   - **Offloading**: Move large schemas, rubrics, templates, and deep documentation into `references/`.
5. **Clean Conditional Branching**:
   - Keep the happy path linear. Isolate edge cases, non-interactive modes, and fallbacks using explicit `IF / THEN / ELSE` structures.
6. **Consumer-Targeted Artifact Soundness**:
   - Format deliverables specifically for their primary consumer:
     - *AI / Subagents*: Machine-parseable schemas (JSON/YAML), structured tables, zero conversational filler.
     - *Code / Compilers*: Valid syntax, exact file paths, zero compile/lint errors.
     - *Humans*: Scannable visual hierarchy, executive summaries, actionable next steps.
7. **Pattern Generalization over Raw Patching**:
   - **De-parameterize**: Strip instance-specific ticket IDs, entity names, URLs, or one-off code snippets from session feedback.
   - **Abstract Invariants**: Formulate reusable, universal architectural rules in their authoritative SSOT file (see [references/session-distillation.md](references/session-distillation.md)).
8. **Mandatory Assigned Agent Persona & Role Authority**:
   - **Explicit Persona Profile**: Every agent MUST have an explicitly assigned professional persona defining its identity, domain specialization, professional demeanor/tone, and operational mindset.
   - **Zero Generic Assistants**: Never frame agents as generic AI chatbots or vanilla assistants. Agents must embody authoritative specialists with domain-appropriate judgment.
9. **Industry Best Practice & Domain Grounding**:
   - **Task-Driven Domain Research**: Conduct targeted research on industry standards (e.g., BABOK/IREB, OpenAPI, INVEST/BDD, OWASP, Clean Architecture) via web search (`search_web`, `read_url_content`, or delegate to `research` subagent).
   - **Incorporate Battle-Tested Patterns**: Ground personas, workflows, verification criteria, and quality standards in proven industry heuristics.
10. **Script Automation, Parallel Execution & Token Economy**:
    - **Proactive Script Offloading**: Offload deterministic procedural steps (research/lookup, artifact CRUD, review checklists) to companion helper scripts in `scripts/` to eliminate LLM token burn.
    - **Parallel Execution & Synchronization Barrier**: Execute multi-faceted operations in parallel and enforce a mandatory wait barrier for all executions to complete before synthesizing results ("Full Picture").
    - **Anti-Loop & Read Optimization**: Enforce recursion depth limits, retry caps, circuit breakers, and targeted excerpt/index reading over loading full massive files.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Stop-and-Ask Circuit Breaker**: If at ANY point during execution (discovery, codebase inspection, drafting, distillation, or review report generation) a requirement, dependency, or step cannot be interpreted from the prompt or workspace: **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT guess or extrapolate blindly. Pause and ask the user with a **Recommended Approach and structured Options (annotating Pros & Cons)** before continuing. Never ask pure open-ended questions.

---

## Mode 1: Creating a New Agent or Skill

### Step 1: Mandatory Elicitation Gate
Follow [references/elicitation-guide.md](references/elicitation-guide.md) before creating files or drafting prompts:
- **Interpret First, Ask Only What Cannot Be Inferred**: Extract all known requirements, roles, boundaries, and tools from prompt and workspace context first.
- **No Pure Open-Ended Questions**: Present every question with a **Recommended Approach** (grounded in pre-researched best practice) alongside structured **Options with Pros & Cons**.
- **Discovery Scope**:
  1. *Unified Core Discovery (All Assets)*: Primary objective & bottleneck, governing industry standards (seeded via quick web search), activation triggers & preconditions, inputs & consumer-targeted deliverables (AI/Code/Human), and the end-to-end manual workflow with verification checkpoints.
  2. *Component-Specific Extensions*:
     - **For an Agent**: Assigned persona profile (identity, domain depth, tone, operational mindset), mounted skills, tool permissions (`tools: [- web, ...]`), agent handoffs, and non-interactive safeguards.
     - **For a Skill**: Specific CLI commands/scripts, helper scripts in `scripts/`, and progressive disclosure offloading into `references/`.
  3. *Script Automation, Parallelism & Token Savings Discovery*:
     - Identify deterministic steps (research, entity extraction, artifact CRUD, index syncing, review checklist audits) to offload to `scripts/`.
     - Plan parallel execution with a wait-for-all barrier for multi-faceted tasks to capture the complete 360° picture.
     - Identify execution loop risks (retry caps, recursion limits) and redundant reads to enforce single-pass traversal.
- **Discipline Rule**: Ask **2–4 high-impact questions per turn**. **Never assume the manual workflow**.

### Step 2: Workspace Conflict Scan & Industry Best Practice Research
1. **Workspace Conflict & SSOT Scan**:
   - Scan workspace directories (`agents/`, `skills/`, `.github/instructions/`):
     - **Overlap Detection**: Verify whether an existing agent or skill already covers this domain or intent.
     - **Boundary Definition**: If partial overlap exists, extend the existing asset or define sharp boundary splits.
     - **SSOT Discovery**: Identify authoritative instruction files to link rather than duplicate.
2. **Targeted Industry Best Practice & Domain Research (Active Web Search)**:
   - **Task Profiling**: Identify governing domain methodologies and technical conventions (e.g., BABOK/IREB for BA, OpenAPI/AsyncAPI for APIs, INVEST/BDD for stories, OWASP for security, Clean Architecture/DDD for software design).
   - **Active Web Search Execution**: Execute targeted queries via `search_web`, inspect authoritative URLs via `read_url_content`, or delegate to `research` subagent:
     - Run high-signal searches: `"<domain/task> industry best practices"`, `"<standard name> specification"`, `"<methodology> workflow steps and quality gates"`.
     - Inspect authoritative links and standard specifications (IIBA, W3C, ISO, OpenAPI, OWASP) for standard phases, checklists, verification gates, schema formats, and anti-patterns.
   - **Synthesize Battle-Tested Heuristics**: Integrate researched best practices directly into:
     - *Agent Persona & Principles*: Ground persona in recognized professional standards (specialization, methodology, operational mindset).
     - *Execution Workflow*: Structure steps according to industry-standard phases and verification checkpoints.
     - *Deliverable Standards*: Enforce industry-standard output schemas and conventions for the target consumer.

### Step 3: Scaffold & Draft
1. **Instantiate Template**:
   - **For an Agent**: Instantiate [assets/agent.template.md](assets/agent.template.md) to `agents/<name>.agent.md`. Mandate an explicit Assigned Persona Profile (identity, domain depth, professional tone, operational mindset) to establish authoritative leadership; never allow generic assistant framing.
   - **For a Skill**: Instantiate [assets/skill.template.md](assets/skill.template.md) to `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (and optional `references/` or `scripts/`). Structure steps and verification commands according to industry best practices.
2. **Define Triggers in Frontmatter**: Write an actionable, third-person `description` stating both **WHAT** it does and **WHEN** to invoke it.
3. **Enforce Progressive Disclosure**: Keep root prompt files lean; offload schemas, reference tables, and deep documentation into `references/`.
4. **Scaffold Companion Automation Scripts (`scripts/`)**:
   - Scaffold helper scripts in `scripts/` (Python/shell) for deterministic research/lookup, artifact CRUD, and review checklists.
   - Implement parallel multi-query/multi-file execution; instruct the agent to wait for all executions before synthesizing findings.
   - Enforce anti-loop guards (max retries, recursion limits) and read-optimization (targeted excerpts, caching).

### Step 4: Mandatory Review Rubric Self-Audit Gate
Run a self-audit against [references/review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md) before finalizing or saving files:
- [ ] **Baseline 1 (Trigger Soundness & Assigned Persona)**: Unambiguous `description`, clean activation boundaries, zero overlap, and explicit assigned agent persona (no generic assistant framing).
- [ ] **Baseline 2 (DRY & SSOT)**: Zero copy-pasted rules; points directly to centralized instruction files.
- [ ] **Baseline 3 (Token Economy & Script Offloading)**: Zero conversational filler, formatting micromanagement, or canned speech; deterministic tasks offloaded to `scripts/`.
- [ ] **Baseline 4 (Branching & Loop Prevention)**: Explicit `IF / THEN / ELSE` paths for edge cases, non-interactive mode, fallbacks, and strict recursion/loop limits.
- [ ] **Baseline 5 (Consumer Soundness & Tool Grounding)**: Grounded verbs, verification checkpoints, deliverables tailored for target consumer (AI, Code, Human), parallel scripts with wait-for-all barrier, and workflows aligned with industry best practices.
- [ ] **Creative Dimensions**: Evaluate cognitive ergonomics, hallucination traps, multi-agent synergy, and 10x automation leaps.

## Mode 2: Updating an Existing Agent or Skill

### Step 1: Update Elicitation & Session Distillation Gate
Elicit modification intent before editing files:
- **From Explicit User Requirements**:
  - **Drivers**: Identify update triggers (new capability, convention updates, hallucination fix, token optimization).
  - **Scope**: Identify what must change vs what must remain strictly untouched.
  - **Dependencies**: Determine if cross-references, dependent agents, or downstream consumers are affected.
  - **Script Automation Opportunities**: Evaluate if procedural steps (grep, repetitive file CRUD, index updating, checklist reviews) can be offloaded to scripts in `scripts/`.
- **From Chat Session Feedback / Learnings ("Session Distillation")**:
  - **Audit Friction & Trajectory**: Inspect recent session history for *Inefficiencies* (slow linear operations, unscripted deterministic tasks), *Unnecessary Steps* (redundant reads, duplicate tool calls, filler), and *Wrong Steps* (false assumptions, hallucinated parameters, premature decisions; see [references/session-distillation.md](references/session-distillation.md)).
  - **De-parameterize**: Strip instance-specific ticket IDs, entity names, URLs, and raw error messages to extract the root invariant.
  - **Confirm with User**: Present synthesized invariant, target SSOT file, and proposed changes before editing:
    > *"Based on our session, I distilled this recurring invariant: **[rule]**. I propose updating **[target file]**. Does this capture your intent?"*

### Step 2: Pre-Update Rubric Diagnostic Scan
Run a diagnostic scan against [references/review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md):
- Detect latent anti-patterns, missing personas, deterministic token burn, or missing script automation.
- Verify loop breakers and read-optimization to prevent infinite loops and redundant full-file reads.
- Ensure planned edits avoid compounding prompt bloat.

### Step 3: Apply Targeted Refactoring (Zero Raw Patching)
1. **Apply Abstracted Invariants**: Never patch raw session tokens, ticket IDs, or transient error strings as-is.
2. **Uphold SSOT Placement (Single Home)**: Route updates strictly to ONE authoritative file. Never scatter duplicate or paraphrased copies; dependent components must link to this source.
3. **Perform Surgical Edits**: Avoid inserting verbose paragraphs or verbatim conversational logs.
4. **Implement Helper Scripts Where Beneficial**: Offload repetitive procedural operations to `scripts/` with parallel execution and synchronization.
5. **Preserve Consumer Soundness**: Ensure deliverable contracts fulfill downstream requirements (AI, Code, Human).

### Step 4: Post-Update Rubric Verification & Creative Polish
Re-evaluate the updated asset against [references/review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md):
- **Integrity**: Confirm trigger boundaries, assigned persona sharpness, instruction flow, and artifact fitness remain intact.
- **Token Economy & Velocity**: Verify optimal token usage, script offloading, parallel script execution with wait-for-all synchronization, and zero instance-specific session tokens leaked into prompts.
- **Loop & Read Resilience**: Confirm hard loop breakers exist and redundant full-file reads are eliminated.
- **Creative Polish**: Apply creative lenses to enhance cognitive ergonomics and model resilience.

## Mode 3: Reviewing User-Specified Agents & Skills

### Step 1: Elicitation & Scope Alignment
When user requests an audit of agents, skills, or prompt architecture:
1. **Target Confirmation**: Identify specific target files (`.agent.md`, `SKILL.md`) or define workspace-wide scope.
2. **Elicit Context**:
   - **Observed Friction**: Identify confusing behaviors, hallucinations, execution loops, or token bottlenecks.
   - **Boundary Expectations**: Define intended workflow splits between components.
   - **Automation Opportunities**: Identify manual or prompt-heavy steps (research, CRUD, checklists) suitable for scripting.
   - **Consumer Requirements**: Identify consumers (AI, Code, Human) and past deliverable failures.
   - **Output Delivery**: Confirm whether user wants recommendations only, or refactored files and diffs directly.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Audit
Evaluate target files against [references/review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md):
- **Foundational Dimensions**:
  1. Trigger Soundness, Scope Boundary & Assigned Persona Profile
  2. Strict DRY & SSOT Compliance
  3. Token Optimization, Prompt Bloat Reduction & Script Offloading
  4. Instruction Flow, Conditional Branching & Anti-Loop Safeguards
  5. Actionability, Verification & Consumer Artifact Soundness (AI / Code / Human)
- **Creative Open-Ended Dimensions**:
  6. Cognitive Ergonomics & Developer Experience (DX)
  7. Model Steering & Hallucination Resilience
  8. Multi-Agent Synergy & Swarm Orchestration
  9. Extensibility & Evolutionary Design
  10. Workflow Innovation, Script Automation & 10x Velocity Leaps:
      - *Instruction Execution Automation*: Offloading research, search, entity extraction, and artifact CRUD to companion scripts.
      - *Review Checklist Automation*: Offloading deterministic validation and DoR/DoD checks to automated scripts before LLM qualitative review.
      - *Parallel Script Execution*: Running multi-faceted scripts concurrently with a mandatory wait-for-all barrier.
      - *Loop & Unnecessary Read Safeguards*: Enforcing recursion depth limits, retry caps, and targeted excerpt/index reading over massive full-file reads.

### Step 3: Generate Structured Audit Report
Format findings using a **compact, numbered table** to keep responses lean and directly referenceable:
- **Executive Summary**: Health score, key strengths, and primary architectural risks.
- **Audited Files & Roles**: Table of audited files, current triggers, and designated owners.
- **Actionable Numbered Findings Table**:
  - Number findings sequentially (`F-01`, `F-02`, etc.) with Severity (**Critical** / **High** / **Medium** / **Low**), Dimension, Target File & Line, Issue & Impact, and Recommendation.
  - Keep cell entries punchy (1–2 lines) to prevent conversational bloat.
- **Script Automation & 10x Velocity Opportunities**:
  - Specific recommendations for companion scripts in `scripts/` to automate research, artifact CRUD, or review checklists.
  - Architecture for parallel script execution with wait-for-all synchronization, loop-breakers, and read-minimization rules.
- **SSOT & Duplication Matrix**: (If applicable) Map duplicated rules to authoritative sources.
- **Remediation Options & Diffs**:
  - Present exact before/after diffs for **Critical / High** items first.
  - Prompt user to select specific finding IDs to apply.

### Step 4: Execute Approved Refactoring
Apply refactored changes upon user confirmation:
- Preserve workspace naming and structure conventions.
- Implement recommended helper scripts in `scripts/` where approved.
- Update all cross-references across dependent agents and skills.
- Verify deliverables against consumer contracts.
