# Vision & Scope — `<Project Name>`

> **Authoring Rule**: Populate every section from the signed-off elicitation session output. Do not fabricate facts. Mark any uncertain items with `Candidate` status and park gaps in Open Questions. This file is the commercial and scope baseline for all downstream decomposition, story authoring, and Change Request (CR) detection.
